<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project was made to help me practice more about react, its reducer hook, and how to integrate CI/CD into the project. It is a simple e-commerce site intended to clone Amazon's layout and functionality. Well, I sort of changed how the products are presented on the page with some animation. It also has authentication and payment processing which is powered by Stripe. In the future, I'll continue add more stuff and refactor/improve the project. But now, I'm devoting my time into other projects.
